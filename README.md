This is Work Day Scheduler
it uses jquery moment.js and bootstrap to create a webpage that interacts with the text you put on it and with the current time of day.
on this page you can enter data into the fields and it will save your response in local storage and will return your response upon refresh of the webpage.
this website uses html css and js to complete all of this.
